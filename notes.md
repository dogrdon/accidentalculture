dpla api:

to search the API by format, use `sourceResource.type` parameter. Or `sourceResource.format`? It appears the sourceResource.type is more often applied and sourceResource.format appears less frequently and in less predictable ways. That is, for example, values for sourceResource.format are (formats for sound appear to be the duration of some audio recordings). sourceResource.type maps to the search facet for format in the browser.

Values for sourceResource.type are:

	* "image"
	* "moving image"**
	* "sound"
	* "text"
	* "physical object"**
