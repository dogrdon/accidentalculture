She describes her family, the Charlets, and provides details about Jewish life in Centralia, Washington, where she grew up. Eva moved to Olympia after marrying Alan Goldberg, a son of Jacob Goldberg. She traces the Goldberg family’s move from North Dakota to Washington State and talks about the Jewish community in Olympia, the synagogue there, how observant Jews managed to get Kosher meat, and about Jewish education for the children. She discusses the Depression years and the anti-Semitic activities of the Silver Shirts, who had an encampment near Olympia. Eva also describes Jewish participation in Fort Lewis and at Evergreen College and relationships with the Jewish staff there. The interview concludes with a discussion of the family home on Hood Canal where the various Goldberg families would come during summer, for Passover, and other family events.
