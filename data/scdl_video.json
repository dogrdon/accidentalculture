He piloted his tug boat to see a friend in North Charleston who was an Admiral of a submarine fleet, and was in the next week. He served aboard the USS DuPage, an attack transport that deployed Marines during Pacific Island invasions. The ship participated in 16 invasions, and Hazzard said the most harrowing was that of Pelelieu, a bitter battle that raged for 12 days. During that invasion, a nearby barge full of ammunition was hit on the port side by 500-lb bombs, and limped into a landing before its crew jumped off. Hazzard waded out to the barge, felt his way through the smoking engine room, and cut the fuel lines. \"If that barge went up, it would have blown everything nearby to bits,\" he recalled. His heroics earned him a Silver Star for conspicuous gallantry in action. During the invasion of the Lingayen Gulf in 1944, the DuPage was hit by a kamikaze aircraft, killing all on deck - except Hazzard. \"I was listed among the dead until I came to,\" he recalled.","format":["Oral Histories"],"genre":["Oral Histories"],"rights":"This video history is part of the Georgetown County Library.

One time, he was hung from his thumbs for two days. \"My toes touched the ground, so I could still crawl back to my hut when they cut me down,\" he said. \"Lots of men couldn't move, and they were beheaded on the spot.\" When Japan surrendered, Dunlap was at a mining camp in Japan. \"The camp colonel read the proclamation, and we all hit the ground and cried and hollered.\"","format":["Oral Histories"],"genre":["Oral Histories"],"rights":"This video history is part of the Georgetown County Library.

In 1943, as soon as he turned 18, he joined the Army Air Corps as an aviation cadet. He first served on an air base in Liverpool, England, armoring fighter planes in-between missions. He joined the 75th Division just after the Battle of the Bulge, and helped clear German troops through the Ruhr Valley. One of his worst memories is of breaking into a work camp at Belsen, where dead prisoners were \"stacked like cordwood.\" the German soldiers had run away and left them to starve.","format":["Oral Histories"],"genre":["Oral Histories"],"rights":"This video history is part of the Georgetown County Library.
