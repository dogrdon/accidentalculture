          "In this interview, Leona Williams discusses her life in Birmingham, Alabama, during the Depression and the Civil Rights movement. Williams was a domestic on and off during her life. After she moved to Birmingham, she also worked at a funeral home. She recounts living through the Depression, how she was working as the cook and maid for a banker, so she had plenty to eat and could share her earnings with her family. She says her family had no garden, and they cut wood for fuel. She also recalls the Roosevelts coming to Birmingham for a visit. Williams talks about living in the country before her mother brought her to the city. She calls their home a \"little shack house,\" with four rooms and no electricity. She talks about schools in the country as well as how they handled medical problems with no doctors. She describes coming to Birmingham and says she doesn't think of herself as a country person anymore. Williams also describes her participation in the Civil Rights movement. She says she was involved with several marches and knew Martin Luther King, Jr. She cooked for the protesters and often put them up at her house. She remembers having dogs set loose on them, as well as being hit with a spray of water hard enough that she remembers seeing people cut and bleeding, just from the water. She also recalls seeing two men shot at a march. Williams also discusses an incident in which a man claiming to be a police officer caught her out late at night trying to get to her sister's house; he propositioned her, and when she refused, he took her to the police station. But her employers at the time were well known, and they got her released.",

        "description": "The first to immigrant to Arizona was Christian Cline, an English former bondservant from Pennsylvania. The family first immigrated to California during the gold rush. They panned enough gold to purchase a small herd of cattle in San Diego, and moved them to the future Roosevelt Dam basin on the Salt River sometime before or during the Civil War. They found the mature grasses too tough and reedy for the cattle to survive, so was forced to relocate south of Tucson. Indians drove them back out after killing a couple of their sons. They returned and started burning the old grass to improve the feed, but within a year the varmints had nearly decimated the herd. This time, while one part of the family went back to California and bought replacement cattle, another group went to New Mexico for hunting dogs. Steve's great grandfather, John Leroy Cline, was just 11 or 12 years old when on the return trip from California he was shot in the leg by bandits, the result being he walked with a limp the rest of his life. The Clines settled where Tonto Creek meets the Salt River and opened up a general store and post office. There were only a few peaceful Indians remaining in the area by then because the U.S. Cavalry had already driven the Apaches out to form the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation. Steve talks briefly about local legends, the Apache Kid, Nachez and Al Seiber. After the flood covered their original homestead, they relocated just east of the A Cross (Armer) Ranch. John Leroy Cline, while not found guilty, lost everything he had, his ranch and cattle there, the result of the ambush and murder of Territorial Charlie Edwards, a psychopath whose father was the Territorial Judge. Now, too old to start another ranch, he relocated to the Tonto Basin area where the family still lives. John Leroy Cline opened another store and saloon, providing a warm meal and bootleg for the locals and travelers through the area. Steve's grandfather, George Cline, was now a young man who, while working on the Roosevelt Dam had met his future bride, Roxy Libby Solomon, the daughter of a teamster.",

They found the mature grasses too tough and reedy for the cattle to survive, so was forced to relocate south of Tucson. Indians drove them back out after killing a couple of their sons. They returned and started burning the old grass to improve the feed, but within a year the varmints had nearly decimated the herd. This time, while one part of the family went back to California and bought replacement cattle, another group went to New Mexico for hunting dogs. Steve's great grandfather, John Leroy Cline, was just 11 or 12 years old when on the return trip from California he was shot in the leg by bandits, the result being he walked with a limp the rest of his life. The Clines settled where Tonto Creek meets the Salt River and opened up a general store and post office. There were only a few peaceful Indians remaining in the area by then because the U.S. Cavalry had already driven the Apaches out to form the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation. Steve talks briefly about local legends, the Apache Kid, Nachez and Al Seiber. After the flood covered their original homestead, they relocated just east of the A Cross (Armer) Ranch. John Leroy Cline, while not found guilty, lost everything he had, his ranch and cattle there, the result of the ambush and murder of Territorial Charlie Edwards, a psychopath whose father was the Territorial Judge. Now, too old to start another ranch, he relocated to the Tonto Basin area where the family still lives. John Leroy Cline opened another store and saloon, providing a warm meal and bootleg for the locals and travelers through the area. Steve's grandfather, George Cline, was now a young man who, while working on the Roosevelt Dam had met his future bride, Roxy Libby Solomon, the daughter of a teamster.",

About 4 years later, his father Benjamin Baker Cline was bucked off his horse and killed while putting cattle out. Steve was 23 years old. Having been raised on the ranch, he knew well how to be a cowboy, but now suddenly he was thrust into the role of a rancher. He learned quickly there's a difference between being a cowboy and a rancher. He credits his grandfather George Cline, a seasoned and successful rancher himself, for saving the ranch. Now alone, Steve took on the awesome task of finishing his father's work of cleaning the land of wild cattle. Steve recalls his dogs who served as indispensable cowhands, and tells some funny dog stories. He also talks about the bear predation with bear stories. About the time he got his numbers down to the Forest Service allotment, drought, environmentalists and the U.S. Forest Service pulled out the rest of his cattle. Now in the past years he's been building up a small herd of about 43 head, crossing over from Herefords to Charolais. Cattle in the U.S. is down about 12 percent so the market is picking up. He takes them to the Phoenix auction instead of Globe. He used to be the president of the Gila County Cattle Growers Assoc. in the mid-late 1990's but after the cattle was moved out, there was no purpose left. He mentions in 2002, when the Forest Service made everyone gather all their cattle, that he hired Joe Haught to help him and was struck by what a remarkable, hardworking and genuine character Joe Haught was, calling him one of the last of the cowboys. Steve has now passed on the ranch legacy to his two sons and grandchildren, giving them charge over the 110 acre ranch.",

About the time he got his numbers down to the Forest Service allotment, drought, environmentalists and the U.S. Forest Service pulled out the rest of his cattle. Now in the past years he's been building up a small herd of about 43 head, crossing over from Herefords to Charolais. Cattle in the U.S. is down about 12 percent so the market is picking up. He takes them to the Phoenix auction instead of Globe. He used to be the president of the Gila County Cattle Growers Assoc. in the mid-late 1990's but after the cattle was moved out, there was no purpose left. He mentions in 2002, when the Forest Service made everyone gather all their cattle, that he hired Joe Haught to help him and was struck by what a remarkable, hardworking and genuine character Joe Haught was, calling him one of the last of the cowboys. Steve has now passed on the ranch legacy to his two sons and grandchildren, giving them charge over the 110 acre ranch.",

Having been raised on the ranch, he knew well how to be a cowboy, but now suddenly he was thrust into the role of a rancher. He learned quickly there's a difference between being a cowboy and a rancher. He credits his grandfather George Cline, a seasoned and successful",

          "This is the audio from Springfield College's 1964 Commencement Ceremonies. The first side (which is thirty-two minutes long) has roughly twenty-seven minutes of band music. The band opens with The Hebrides Suite and then transitions into Pomp and Circumstance. Around the twenty-eight minute mark, Reverend Robert A. Potter gives the invocation, followed by the hymn God Of Our Fathers. The second side opens immediately with then-president Dr. Glenn A. Olds introducing that year’s commencement speaker: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. At two minutes and forty seconds, Dr. King begins speaking. In this speech, he talks about social change, poverty, and brotherhood, saying: \"We must all learn to live together as brothers, or we will all perish together as fools.\" There is no audio during the conferring of the degrees—at thirty-three minutes, Dr. King’s speech ends and, after applause, you hear the choir singing A Song for Springfield, followed by Benediction and the Recessional. In 1964, Springfield College shared a moment in history often overlooked by historians with honorary degree recipient and commencement speaker Martin Luther King Jr. Despite significant pressure from prominent shareholders and benefactors of the College, college President Glenn A. Olds, a minister and conscientious objector during World War II, refused to waver from his decision to make Martin Luther King Commencement speaker for the 1964 Graduation ceremonies. When King was arrested the day before, Olds contacted law enforcement officials, telling them that if they continued to hold King, school officials would fly down to tape the commencement address, leaving St. Augustine to deal with the attendant publicity. Whether or not his intervention played a role, King was released on a nine hundred dollar bond Saturday afternoon. Met at the airport by Springfield College Economics Professor Robert Randolph, later the first black president of the Massachusetts State College System at Westfield State, King toured the campus, gave a press conference, and shared a brief luncheon with faculty and administration. On the day of commencement, Black Muslim protestors who felt King was too conciliatory and bomb-sniffing dogs greeted the graduating class.

          "An audio recording of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s June 1964 Commencement speech at Springfield College. We believe that Dr. Glenn Olds gave the introduction. In 1964, Springfield College shared a moment in history often overlooked by historians with honorary degree recipient and commencement speaker Martin Luther King Jr. Despite significant pressure from prominent shareholders and benefactors of the College to not invite Martin Luther King to speak at Commencement, college President Glenn A. Olds, a minister and conscientious objector during World War II, refused to waver. When King was arrested the day before, Olds contacted law enforcement officials, telling them that if they continued to hold King, school officials would fly down to tape the commencement address, leaving St. Augustine to deal with the attendant publicity. Whether or not his intervention played a role, King was released on a nine hundred dollar bond Saturday afternoon. Met at the airport by Springfield College Economics Professor Robert Randolph, later the first black president of the Massachusetts State College System at Westfield State, King toured the campus, gave a press conference, and shared a brief luncheon with faculty and administration. On the day of commencement, Black Muslim protestors who felt King was too conciliatory and bomb-sniffing dogs greeted the graduating class.
