Asbelle graduated from St. Mary's Hospital School of Nursing, San Francisco, CA in 1938 and entered the Navy later that year on 7 November 1938. She first served as Naval Hospital San Diego, CA (1938-1940) before being transferred to the Naval Hospital at Pearl Harbor (TH). While at the hospital, Asbelle was among the first-hand responders during the attack on the naval base on 7 December 1941. In the interview, she describes treatment of burn patients and recalls the young sailors lining up for 'tannic acid application.' Asbelle later served two tours at Naval Hospital Mare Island, CA (1943; 1948-50), Naval Hospital Adak, AK (1944), National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD (1945), Naval Dispensary-Naval Air Station Quonset Point, RI (1945-46) and Naval Hospital Oakland, CA (1950-53). While at Mare Island and Oakland (Oak Knoll), Asbelle served in the Occupational Therapy Departments where she worked with the originator of the 'below the knee' prosthesis, CAPT Thomas Canty, MC, USN. Upon getting married in 1953, Asbelle was forced to leave the Navy due to the regulations barring active duty servicewomen from being married without a waiver.
