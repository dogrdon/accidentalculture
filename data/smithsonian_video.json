The eyes are dark and reflect pinpoints of light, the brows are heavy, the nose is shadowed on the proper right, and the full lips are pale pink.

In the left panel, the facial area below the eye ends in a curve against a dark brown background, and the album title, again in small red capitals, is imprinted in a curve following the facial edge.","Verso: The flesh tone of the facial portrait continues on the left (see Side Panels, above); the video title is imprinted on the right of the this top left section and the names of the band personnel, followed by Talking Heads","Are imprinted slightly below to the left. A narrative description of the video content completes this section. The story titles, in white type on a brown background (which might depict the hair of the portrait subject), are listed vertically on the right. In about two thirds of the space in the lower half, there is reproduction of a 1930's black and white photograph of a man, woman, teenage boy and younger girl standing in a row; an actual male giant, his hands on the shoulders of the two end figures in the front row, is standing behind them. Everyone is smiling; they appear to be a family group. Part of a house with a peaked roof is on the left behind the group and trees in leaf are on the right. Brief biographical facts about the giant are imprinted on six lines in small black type to the left of the photograph. Production data in white on a brown rectangle, which overlays part of the photograph, is on the left bottom.","Top flap: Where the lower edge of the flap meets the recto, Talking Heads in blue capitals, followed by the video title in red, are imprinted in small capitals.

The museum acquired this piece of film with the Vitascope #2 movie projector, an early model of the film projector that Thomas Edison's company manufactured in the early 20th century. Though the title of this particular subject is unknown, it is most likely from a short Edison film of a yacht race around 1900.","@label":"Description (Brief)"},{"#text":"The Early Cinema Film and Ephemera Collection [COLL.PHOTOS.000038] includes over 50 pieces of notable motion picture film and more than 80 posters, photographs and other ephemeral objects from cinema’s early days. The collection’s film is primarily short lengths of motion picture film donated by inventors or industry groups to mark technological innovation. Charles Francis Jenkins, the co-inventor of the Vitascope projector, donated a short length of film showing William McKinley’s inauguration. Wallace Goold Levison and E. H. Amet, two early motion picture innovators, gave pieces of film, news clippings and business cards to mark their achievements in the technological development of the medium. The Society of Motion Picture Engineers, the leading trade association for motion picture workers, made two donations of early motion picture film samples, including examples of Biograph and early color motion pictures. Sound cinema pioneer Eugene Augustin Lauste’s scrapbooks and photographs illuminate his work to improve the motion picture as well as the early days of the industry. A portion of the film collection represents the work of pioneers like Charles Urban and August Plahn to perfect a natural and vibrant color for projected film.","@label":"Description"},{"#text":"The Collection also helps to illuminate the rise of the motion picture industry as a cultural and business phenomenon through ephemera. Posters promoting some of the earliest film exhibitions, the films of silent Western star William S. Hart, the 1930 re-release of D.W. Griffith’s Birth of a Nation and features presented at Washington’s Trans-Lux theater illustrate the range of movie advertising from the earliest days of the cinema to the industry’s attempts to combat television competition in the 1950s. A group of photographs of theaters, 270 glass slides used to promote upcoming features and pieces of movie star memorabilia broaden the collection’s focus to that of cinema culture at its zenith of influence in American life.","@label":"Description"},{"#text":"This finding aid is one in a series documenting the PHC’s Early Cinema Collection [COLL.PHOTOS.000018].
