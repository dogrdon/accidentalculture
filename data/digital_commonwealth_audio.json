At the time the university was developing an exhibit about the congressman, entitled John Joseph Moakley: In Service to His Country. The participants reminisce about Moakley’s early life including his family’s life in South Boston in the thirties, forties and fifties; Moakley’s service in the Navy during WWII; his start in politics; his career in Massachusetts legislature during the fifties and sixties; his time at Suffolk University Law School and his law practice; and his late wife Evelyn. They also discuss his congressional career including how the city of Boston changed during his career; Moakley’s role in the Boston school desegregation crisis of the seventies; his tenure on the House Rules Committee; congressional campaigns; policy campaigns central to Moakley’s career such as his work in El Salvador as chairman of a special task force investigating the murder of six Jesuit priests, his work to improve conditions in Cuba and his commitment to veterans. They end by discussing Moakley’s legacy in the state of Massachusetts including his commitment to historic preservation, economic development, transportation projects and the environment.","mods:subject":[{"mods:topic":"Moakley, John Joseph, 1927-2001"},{"mods:topic":"Massachusetts--Politics and Government"},{"mods:topic":"South Boston (Boston, Mass.)"},{"mods:topic":"El Salvador--Politics and government"},{"mods:topic":"United States--Congress"}],"mods:typeOfResource":"sound recording","mods:physicalDescription":{"mods:internetMediaType":["audio/mpeg","application/pdf"]},"mods:accessCondition":[{"displayLabel":"rights","#text":"Copyright Suffolk University.

Snow's The Two Cultures, but indicates that he himself been interested in chemistry as a youth, and had initially intended to major in chemistry as an undergraduate at Vanderbilt University. Explaining that poets \"cultivate ignorance\" and that poems are written \"to find out what you think or feel\" and \"to be alone with that unshaped inside fuzziness,\" Warren contrasts the way of poetry and the way of science, reading a series of poems that obliquely address this distinction, including \"Eidolon\"; \"Original Sin: A Short Story\"; a pair of poems from the sequence \"To a Little Girl, One Year Old, in a Ruined Fortress,\" titled Sirocco\" and \"The Child Next Door\"; \"Country Burying, 1919\"; \"Dragon Country: To Jacob Boheme\"; a poem from the \"Garland for You\" sequence, titled \"Man in the Street\"; \"Harvard '61: Battle Fatigue\"; and three poems from the sequence in process tentatively titled \"Delight,\" titled \"Into Broad Daylight,\" \"Something is Going To Happen,\" and \"Not to be Trusted.\" The most provocative moment of the reading comes in Warren's performance of a poem titled \"So You Agree With What I Say? Well, What Did I Say?\" In prefacing this piece, Warren says: \"here's a little poem that has an IBM machine in it; in fact it ends with one.

Snow's The Two Cultures, but indicates that he himself been interested in chemistry as a youth, and had initially intended to major in chemistry as an undergraduate at Vanderbilt University. Explaining that poets \"cultivate ignorance\" and that poems are written \"to find out what you think or feel\" and \"to be alone with that unshaped inside fuzziness,\" Warren contrasts the way of poetry and the way of science, reading a series of poems that obliquely address this distinction, including \"Eidolon\"; \"Original Sin: A Short Story\"; a pair of poems from the sequence \"To a Little Girl, One Year Old, in a Ruined Fortress,\" titled Sirocco\" and \"The Child Next Door\"; \"Country Burying, 1919\"; \"Dragon Country: To Jacob Boheme\"; a poem from the \"Garland for You\" sequence, titled \"Man in the Street\"; \"Harvard '61: Battle Fatigue\"; and three poems from the sequence in process tentatively titled \"Delight,\" titled \"Into Broad Daylight,\" \"Something is Going To Happen,\" and \"Not to be Trusted.\" The most provocative moment of the reading comes in Warren's performance of a poem titled \"So You Agree With What I Say? Well, What Did I Say?\" In prefacing this piece, Warren says: \"here's a little poem that has an IBM machine in it; in fact it ends with one. You can take that as a tribute if you like.\" Summary and select metadata for this record was submitted by Jim Cocola.","mods:location":[{"mods:physicalLocation":"WGBH"},{"mods:url":[{"#text":"http://openvault.wgbh.org/system/thumbnails/41846e-poetry-from-m-i-t-robert-penn-warren/preview.jpg","access":"preview"},{"usage":"primary","#text":"http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/41846e-poetry-from-m-i-t-robert-penn-warren","access":"object in context"}]}],"version":"3.4","mods:subject":[{"authority":"tgn","mods:hierarchicalGeographic":{"mods:county":"Worcester","mods:country":"United States","mods:continent":"North and Central America","mods:state":"Massachusetts","mods:city":"Cambridge"},"mods:cartographics":{"mods:coordinates":"42.2333,-71.80"},"authorityURI":"http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn","valueURI":"http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/2215680"},{"mods:topic":"Art and Science"},{"mods:topic":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"mods:topic":"Artistic Influences"},{"mods:topic":"Poetry readings (Sound recordings)"},{"mods:name":{"type":"personal","mods:namePart":["Warren, Robert Penn",{"#text":"1905-1989","type":"date"}]}},{"mods:topic":"United States Poet Laureate"},{"mods:topic":"Poetry"},{"mods:topic":"Cambridge, Massachusetts"}],"mods:typeOfResource":"sound recording","mods:physicalDescription":{"mods:extent":"1/4 inch audiotape, 00:52:59;00"},"mods:accessCondition":[{"displayLabel":"rights","#text":"Rights status not evaluated.","type":"use and reproduction"},{"displayLabel":"license","#text":"Contact host institution for more information.","type":"use and reproduction"}],"xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","mods:relatedItem":{"type":"host","mods:titleInfo":{"mods:title":"WGBH Open Vault"}},"xmlns:xlink":"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink","xmlns:mods":"http://www.loc.gov/mods/v3"}}}}},

Mr. Hennigan reflects on the issue of busing in the Boston Public School system, recalling the Boston School Committee’s work in the years prior to the Garrity decision and the roles which various politicians and city leaders played in the debate. He reminisces about Boston’s great politicians. Additionally, he recalls his memories of Joe Moakley’s successful run as an Independent candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1972. Mr. Hennigan also shares a bit of his political career and that of his family.","mods:subject":[{"mods:topic":"Busing for school integration"},{"mods:topic":"Boston (Mass)--School Committee"},{"mods:topic":"Moakley, John Joseph, 1927-2001"},{"mods:topic":"Morgan v.

Various civil rights groups picketed outside the Boston School Committee Headquarters at 15 Beacon Street during the summer. Later, the School Committee conceded to meet with the NAACP on August 13, 1963 only to summarily end the meeting when Ruth Batson, Chair of the Education Committee, mentioned the term, “de facto segregation.” On Thursday, September 5, 1963, the NAACP stepped up the nonviolent direct action protests by organizing a Sit-In at the School Committee Headquarters. In the “Boston School Committee Report on Sit-Ins,” WGBH interviews Thomas Atkins, Executive Secretary of the Boston Branch of the NAACP who explains the grievances and events leading up to the Sit-In demonstration.

Bare Meadow was acquired from three major sources between 1972 and 1973. The largest parcel was a gift from Miriam Corey. More acreage was acquired from Reading residents, Mr. Bachelor and Mr. Zilano. The remainder of the land was acquired through smaller purchases. An additional 30 acres was added to Bare Meadow in 1983 by swapping a smaller parcel of highland with a citizen for a desired area. In 2007, the town purchased the abutting Mattera property at 1481 N. Main St., including a cabin. There are four entrances to Bare Meadow, all marked by large brown signs. The two primary entrances are off Pearl St. next to #717 and at the Mattera Cabin at 1481 North Main St. Both have ample off-street parking. The third is off Haverhill St. north of Batchelder Road. Parking is available on Batchelder Rd. The fourth is off Franklin Street next to the Wood End Cemetery. Parking is available in the cemetery and on Partridge Road. Bare Meadow includes a wonderful variety of terrain and plant communities. At the western end there are two small open meadows with long grasses, remnants of an apple orchard. In the center there are beautiful wooded areas and rocky hills with a network of trails that connect with the Northern Area Greenway. The property spans from Main Street to Haverhill Street. Many stone walls mark earlier farming uses of this land. Bare Meadow Brook flows through red maple swamps and open marshes on the western side and joins the Ipswich River at the northern end of the conservation lands. There are six certified vernal pools in Bare Meadow. Many plant species can be found here including lady slippers, partridge berry, marsh marigold, prince s pine, trout lily, witch hazel, and others. Wildlife is plentiful. There are white-tailed deer, red fox, coyote, raccoon, and others. It s a great area for bird watching. The American woodcock nests here, and in the early spring it performs an amazing courtship flight over the two meadows. Great horned owls nest here and recently, Bluebirds have nested in the bluebird boxes installed in the meadow that can be viewed from a platform at the high spot of the meadow. Recent improvements to Bare Meadow have included the construction of a handicapped accessible trail running approximately 150 yards from the parking lot at the Mattera cabin to a new viewing platform constructed at the highest point overlooking the meadow. In addition, the trails have been cleared and improved with new blazes, boardwalks, signage, and maps. Bare Meadow is a wonderful place to visit year round. Spring brings the advent of wild flowers, nesting birds, and a chorus of frogs calling from the vernal pools. The beautiful oak and pine forest offer a respite from the hot summer days, while in the autumn, Bare Meadow comes alive with the colors of fall. During the winter, folks can enjoy sledding, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing along the well-marked trails."],"@id":"http://dp.la/api/items/626b88540aaa57a7d1a8f1d570f4845a#sourceResource","language":[{"iso639_3":"eng","name":"English"}],"identifier":["Local other: 3169880"]},"@id":"http://dp.la/api/items/626b88540aaa57a7d1a8f1d570f4845a","ingestType":"item","originalRecord":{"id":"oai:digitalcommonwealth.org:commonwealth-oai:n009wf21t","provider":{"@id":"http://dp.la/api/contributor/digital-commonwealth","name":"Digital Commonwealth"},"collection":{"id":"15802ca93dc720968402257e9c97eb37","description":"","title":"Walkable Reading","@id":"http://dp.la/api/collections/15802ca93dc720968402257e9c97eb37"},"header":{"identifier":"oai:digitalcommonwealth.org:commonwealth-oai:n009wf21t","setSpec":"commonwealth-oai:n009wf109","datestamp":"2015-12-09T13:01:38Z"},"metadata":{"mods:mods":{"mods:name":{"mods:role":{"mods:roleTerm":{"authority":"marcrelator","#text":"Creator","authorityURI":"http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators","type":"text","valueURI":"http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/cre"}},"mods:namePart":"Walkable Reading"},"mods:titleInfo":{"usage":"primary","mods:title":"Bare Meadow conservation area","displayLabel":"primary_display"},"mods:genre":[{"authority":"gmgpc","displayLabel":"general","#text":"Photographs","authorityURI":"http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/graphicMaterials","valueURI":"http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/graphicMaterials/tgm007721"},{"authority":"lctgm","displayLabel":"general","#text":"Sound recordings","authorityURI":"http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/graphicMaterials","valueURI":"http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/graphicMaterials/tgm009874"}],"mods:originInfo":{"mods:dateCreated":{"keyDate":"yes","encoding":"w3cdtf","#text":"2010"},"mods:place":{"mods:placeTerm":{"type":"text","#text":"Reading, Mass"}},"mods:publisher":"Walkable Reading"},"mods:recordInfo":{"mods:recordContentSource":"Reading Public Library","mods:recordOrigin":"OAI-PMH request"},"mods:identifier":[{"#text":"3169880","type":"local-other"},{"#text":"http://heritage.noblenet.org/items/show/16976","type":"uri"}],"mods:language":{"mods:languageTerm":{"authority":"iso639-2b","#text":"English","authorityURI":"http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2","type":"text","valueURI":"http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng"}},"xsi:schemaLocation":"http://www.loc.gov/mods/v3 http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-3-5.xsd","mods:location":[{"mods:physicalLocation":"Reading Public Library"},{"mods:url":{"usage":"primary","#text":"http://heritage.noblenet.org/items/show/16976","access":"object in context"}}],"version":"3.5","mods:note":["Information about this item was supplied by NOBLE Digital Heritage.","1 audio file (4:05) : Listen Now (or right-click to save file)","digital, MPEG file","Bare Meadow is a125-acre site located in the northeast area of Reading.

The two primary entrances are off Pearl St. next to #717 and at the Mattera Cabin at 1481 North Main St. Both have ample off-street parking. The third is off Haverhill St. north of Batchelder Road. Parking is available on Batchelder Rd. The fourth is off Franklin Street next to the Wood End Cemetery. Parking is available in the cemetery and on Partridge Road. Bare Meadow includes a wonderful variety of terrain and plant communities. At the western end there are two small open meadows with long grasses, remnants of an apple orchard. In the center there are beautiful wooded areas and rocky hills with a network of trails that connect with the Northern Area Greenway. The property spans from Main Street to Haverhill Street. Many stone walls mark earlier farming uses of this land. Bare Meadow Brook flows through red maple swamps and open marshes on the western side and joins the Ipswich River at the northern end of the conservation lands. There are six certified vernal pools in Bare Meadow. Many plant species can be found here including lady slippers, partridge berry, marsh marigold, prince s pine, trout lily, witch hazel, and others. Wildlife is plentiful. There are white-tailed deer, red fox, coyote, raccoon, and others. It s a great area for bird watching. The American woodcock nests here, and in the early spring it performs an amazing courtship flight over the two meadows. Great horned owls nest here and recently, Bluebirds have nested in the bluebird boxes installed in the meadow that can be viewed from a platform at the high spot of the meadow. Recent improvements to Bare Meadow have included the construction of a handicapped accessible trail running approximately 150 yards from the parking lot at the Mattera cabin to a new viewing platform constructed at the highest point overlooking the meadow. In addition, the trails have been cleared and improved with new blazes, boardwalks, signage, and maps. Bare Meadow is a wonderful place to visit year round. Spring brings the advent of wild flowers, nesting birds, and a chorus of frogs calling from the vernal pools. The beautiful oak and pine forest offer a respite from the hot summer days, while in the autumn, Bare Meadow comes alive with the colors of fall. During the winter, folks can enjoy sledding, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing along the well-marked trails."],"mods:subject":[{"mods:topic":"Massachusetts--Middlesex (county)--Reading"},{"mods:topic":"Reading (Mass.)--History"},{"authority":"tgn","mods:hierarchicalGeographic":{"mods:county":"Middlesex","mods:country":"United States","mods:continent":"North and Central America","mods:state":"Massachusetts","mods:city":"Reading"},"mods:cartographics":{"mods:coordinates":"42.5167,-71.0833"},"authorityURI":"http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/","valueURI":"http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/7014313"}],"mods:typeOfResource":"sound recording","mods:physicalDescription":{"mods:internetMediaType":"audio/mpeg"},"mods:accessCondition":[{"displayLabel":"rights","#text":"Rights status not evaluated.","type":"use and reproduction"},{"displayLabel":"license","#text":"Contact host institution for more information.","type":"use and reproduction"}],"xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","mods:relatedItem":{"type":"host","mods:titleInfo":{"mods:title":"Walkable Reading"}},"xmlns:xlink":"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink","xmlns:mods":"http://www.loc.gov/mods/v3"}}}}},

The speech was recorded by George Williams on a wax cylinder and sent to Springfield College. It was played during the Jubilee celebrations held on June 6, 1894. This recording is the earliest known copy or re-recording of his speech, dating from around 1937-1946. The recording contains an introduction by American radio broadcaster Milton J. Cross, an introduction to the Williams’ address by Eugene E. Barnett, General Secretary of the National Council of the YMCAs of the United States, a complete reading of a transcript of the Williams’ address by Barnett, and an excerpt of the original Williams’ recording from the wax cylinder. This version does not contain the entire text read by Williams. George Williams was the Founder of the YMCA. In 1844, after becoming a devout Christian, he gathered a group of young men together for prayer and reflection. This simple act developed into the worldwide YMCA movement. By 1845 the YMCA was holding public lectures in rented halls and Sunday afternoon teas at Hotel Radley in London. By 1851 the YMCA had spread to 16 other cities in England, Scotland and Ireland.

The speech was recorded by George Williams on a wax cylinder and sent to Springfield College. It was played during the Jubilee celebrations held on June 6, 1894. This recording is the earliest known copy or re-recording of his speech, dating from around 1937-1946. The recording contains an introduction by American radio broadcaster Milton J. Cross, an introduction to the Williams’ address by Eugene E. Barnett, General Secretary of the National Council of the YMCAs of the United States, a complete reading of a transcript of the Williams’ address by Barnett, and an excerpt of the original Williams’ recording from the wax cylinder. This version does not contain the entire text read by Williams. George Williams was the Founder of the YMCA. In 1844, after becoming a devout Christian, he gathered a group of young men together for prayer and reflection. This simple act developed into the worldwide YMCA movement. By 1845 the YMCA was holding public lectures in rented halls and Sunday afternoon teas at Hotel Radley in London. By 1851 the YMCA had spread to 16 other cities in England, Scotland and Ireland. The YMCA movement reached the American shores in 1851, with the first YMCA established in Montreal on November 25 and the second in Boston December 29. By the time George Williams was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1894, the 50th anniversary of the YMCA, there were 5,000 YMCAs in 24 countries with 500,000 members.

The first side (which is thirty-two minutes long) has roughly twenty-seven minutes of band music. The band opens with The Hebrides Suite and then transitions into Pomp and Circumstance. Around the twenty-eight minute mark, Reverend Robert A. Potter gives the invocation, followed by the hymn God Of Our Fathers. The second side opens immediately with then-president Dr. Glenn A. Olds introducing that year’s commencement speaker: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. At two minutes and forty seconds, Dr. King begins speaking. In this speech, he talks about social change, poverty, and brotherhood, saying: \"We must all learn to live together as brothers, or we will all perish together as fools.\" There is no audio during the conferring of the degrees—at thirty-three minutes, Dr. King’s speech ends and, after applause, you hear the choir singing A Song for Springfield, followed by Benediction and the Recessional. In 1964, Springfield College shared a moment in history often overlooked by historians with honorary degree recipient and commencement speaker Martin Luther King Jr. Despite significant pressure from prominent shareholders and benefactors of the College, college President Glenn A. Olds, a minister and conscientious objector during World War II, refused to waver from his decision to make Martin Luther King Commencement speaker for the 1964 Graduation ceremonies. When King was arrested the day before, Olds contacted law enforcement officials, telling them that if they continued to hold King, school officials would fly down to tape the commencement address, leaving St. Augustine to deal with the attendant publicity. Whether or not his intervention played a role, King was released on a nine hundred dollar bond Saturday afternoon. Met at the airport by Springfield College Economics Professor Robert Randolph, later the first black president of the Massachusetts State College System at Westfield State, King toured the campus, gave a press conference, and shared a brief luncheon with faculty and administration. On the day of commencement, Black Muslim protestors who felt King was too conciliatory and bomb-sniffing dogs greeted the graduating class.
